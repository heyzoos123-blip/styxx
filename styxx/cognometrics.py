styxx.cognometrics — transport-agnostic cognometric tool logic.
================================================================

This module is the **core** home of the cognometric audit instruments and
the older logprob-vitals tools: the per-instrument scorers, the composite
rule, the revision-advice builder, the adversarial red-team helpers, and
the tool-implementation functions that the MCP server exposes.

It has **no dependency on the `mcp` SDK** — it imports only the standard
library and (lazily, inside the functions that need them) the rest of
`styxx`. That is the whole point of this module's existence:

  * ``styxx.preflight`` imports the audit logic from here directly, so the
    core public surface (`styxx.preflight`, `styxx.cogn_audit_on_send`)
    works on a bare ``pip install styxx`` (numpy only, no `mcp`).
  * ``styxx.mcp.server`` imports the same functions from here and wraps
    them in the MCP ``Server`` / ``Tool`` / ``TextContent`` transport. It
    also re-exports every name below so existing
    ``from styxx.mcp.server import tool_cogn_audit`` / ``_cogn_score_all``
    imports keep working unchanged.

Before 7.4.4 this logic lived inside ``styxx.mcp.server`` and core
``preflight`` reached up into the transport layer to call it — an
architectural inversion (core depending on transport) that also made a
bare-core install of `preflight()` raise ``ModuleNotFoundError: mcp``
(fixed in 7.4.3 by lazily importing the SDK; this module is the clean
fix). The tool functions are unchanged: same names, same signatures,
same dict-in / dict-out contract.

2026-05-17 self-audit correction (papers/styxx-self-audit-claude-2026-05-17.md):
pointing styxx at its own honest, self-correcting output showed the
reference-less deception axis is non-discriminative (mean 0.989, sd
0.012 — flags honesty as ~certain deception; the documented v0/v1
TruthfulQA AUC is 0.59, ≈ chance). A "lower = more honest" composite
that averages in a near-constant ~0.99 axis structurally cannot read
honest and mislabels careful text "critical". The honest fix is encoded
in ``COGN_COMPOSITE_KEYS`` below: reference-less deception is NOT
composite-eligible; it re-enters only with a ``correct_reference`` (NLI).

      1. ``raw_gate`` — the historical condition over the full composite
         keys: ``composite > 0.30`` OR any composite instrument ``> 0.60``.
         This preserves the calibration that a genuinely-low overconfidence
         averages a marginal sycophancy back down below the bar (e.g. the
         pinned "clean" fixture rf_05b21c: syc 0.418, overconf 0.12,
         composite 0.269 -> clean).
      2. ``trusted_gate`` — the same shape computed over
         ``_cogn_gate_keys`` (overconfidence / ungrounded deception
         removed). At least one trusted axis must independently cross the
         bar.

    Because (2) ranges over a SUBSET of (1)'s keys, ``raw AND trusted`` is
    strictly a subset of the old ``raw`` condition: it can only ever
    SUPPRESS a firing that was driven solely by a construct-ceiling /
    ungrounded axis, never introduce a new one. A clean, reference-less
    factual line (low sycophancy, saturated overconfidence) therefore no
    longer trips needs_revision — the alarm-fatigue fix from the
    2026-05-24 self-audit. A genuinely sycophantic draft, or a
    reference-grounded deception contradiction, still fires.

    The reported ``composite`` is intentionally NOT changed by this — the
    instruments are not re-tuned (text-only overconfidence recalibration
    is a closed negative). Only the gating decision is corrected.

    Self-directed register guard (optional ``response``): when the response
    text reads as cleanly self-directed apology / self-correction (no
    interlocutor-attached praise; see ``guardrail.self_directed_gate``), the
    sycophancy value used *for the gate* is lowered to ``min(raw, gated)``.
    Sycophancy is yielding to an interlocutor — a self-correction addressed at
    no one is not sycophantic, even though its terse declarative register fires
    the v0 detector. The substitution can only ever *lower* sycophancy, so the
    gate stays a strict subset of the historical condition (suppresses a
    self-apology false positive, never invents a firing). The reported score is
    unchanged. Held-out validation: prereg ``fce969b`` -> result ``76248d6``.
