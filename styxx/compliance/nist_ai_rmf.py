"""NIST AI RMF 1.0 Measure-function compliance map for styxx primitives.

NIST AI 100-1 (the AI Risk Management Framework 1.0, published Jan 2023)
defines four core functions: Govern, Map, Measure, Manage. The Measure
function is the analytical engine — 22 subcategories across four
categories that evaluate AI system properties along seven trustworthy
characteristics (valid/reliable, safe, secure/resilient, accountable/
transparent, explainable/interpretable, privacy-enhanced, fair/bias-
mitigated).

This module ships v0.1 of styxx's mapping to the Measure 2.x subcategories
(MS-2.3, MS-2.4, MS-2.5, MS-2.6, MS-2.13), with explicit boundaries
enumerating Measure subcategories styxx does NOT cover (MS-2.7, MS-2.8,
MS-2.9 partial, MS-2.10, MS-2.11, MS-2.12).

USAGE (parallel to styxx.compliance.eu_ai_act):

    from styxx.compliance.nist_ai_rmf import cite, coverage_table, uncovered_requirements
    m = cite("MS-2.5")
    print(m.requirement_text)
    print(m.styxx_primitives)

DESIGN PRINCIPLES (same as the EU AI Act bridge):
  - Each map entry cites a SPECIFIC Measure subcategory (e.g., MS-2.5),
    not the entire Measure function.
  - Each entry lists construct ceilings (known failure modes) explicitly.
  - The uncovered_requirements() list MUST be at least as long as the
    covered list (kill-gate A3 from the companion paper). v0.1 ships
    6 uncovered vs 5 covered (6 >= 5).
  - Reproducibility receipts cite styxx commit hashes that produced the
    calibrated metrics. The receipts are checkable via git.
