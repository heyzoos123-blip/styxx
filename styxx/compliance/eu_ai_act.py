"""EU AI Act Article 15 / Annex III compliance map for styxx primitives.

This is the v0.1 measurement-methodology bridge described in
papers/EU_AI_ACT_COMPLIANCE_2026.md.

USAGE:

    from styxx.compliance import cite, coverage_table, uncovered_requirements

    # Look up which styxx primitives produce evidence for a clause:
    m = cite("Article 15.1(a)")
    print(m.requirement_text)
    for p in m.styxx_primitives:
        print(p.primitive, p.calibrated_metric)
        print(p.construct_ceiling)        # honest failure mode
        print(p.receipt_commit, p.receipt_doc)  # reproducibility receipt

    # Full coverage table (all mapped clauses):
    for row in coverage_table():
        print(row.clause, row.styxx_primitives)

    # Honest list of EU AI Act requirements styxx does NOT cover:
    for u in uncovered_requirements():
        print(u.clause, u.reason)

DESIGN PRINCIPLES (also pre-stated in the companion paper):
  - Each map entry cites a SPECIFIC Article paragraph or sub-paragraph,
    not generic compliance language.
  - Each entry lists construct ceilings (known failure modes) explicitly,
    not hidden in caveats.
  - The uncovered_requirements() list MUST be at least as long as the
    covered list (kill-gate A3 from the companion paper): the boundary
    of applicability is explicit.
  - Reproducibility receipts cite styxx commit hashes that produced the
    calibrated metrics. The receipts are checkable via git.

NOT legal advice. NOT a substitute for an organization's own AI Act
conformity assessment. Independent legal review required for any
production deployment.
