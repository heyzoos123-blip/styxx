Xendro's #6 request: "styxx has seen enough of my traffic to know
what my failure modes look like. I want styxx.antipatterns() that
says: 'when your confidence drops below 0.3 and creative rate
exceeds 40%, you tend to generate speculative claims.'"

This module reads the audit log and detects recurring patterns that
preceded warn/fail gates. The patterns are derived from the agent's
OWN data, not generic LLM failure modes. They're named, counted,
and described so the agent can recognize them when they start
forming again.
