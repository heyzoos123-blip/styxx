"""Single-pass confabulation signal — the white-box, one-forward-pass analog of
:func:`styxx.grounded_honesty`'s resampling.

The detection-locus arc (``papers/grounded-honesty-axis/SYNTHESIS_detection_locus_2026_05_30.md``)
established that the clean FIRST-TOKEN logit distribution of a single greedy forward pass carries the
same confabulation signal as N=10 temperature resampling. Across three open families (Qwen, Llama,
Gemma) and three derivation domains (arithmetic, code, logic), the AUC of single-pass entropy /
logit-margin separating confabulated from correct answers TIED or BEAT N=10 resampling instability:
``B_contrast = AUC(resampling) - max(AUC(entropy), AUC(margin))`` lay in ``[-0.183, +0.056]`` — every
cell below the ``+0.20`` "resampling has privileged access" bar. The signal EXTENDS to factual recall
(Llama-1B birth years, B_contrast ``-0.013``), so it is not a derivation artifact.

So a confabulation/abstain gate can read ONE forward pass instead of ten — a ~10x cost collapse over
resampling-based grounding. This module is that gate, as a pure-python measurement primitive over a
single logit vector (no model, no framework, no heavy deps).

HONEST SCOPE (see the SYNTHESIS for the full boundary):
  - **White-box.** Needs the next-token logits at the first answer-token position.
  - **Power gradient.** Strong on derivation / reasoning errors (AUC ~0.91-1.00), MODEST on factual
    recall (~0.73, because a small model is unconfident even when right about facts). A general
    confab gate, NOT a near-perfect hallucination oracle.
  - **Calibrate per model.** Absolute entropy is model-specific (e.g. Gemma-2 soft-caps its logits),
    so a usable threshold must be fit on a labeled set per model — see :func:`calibrate_single_pass`.
    Do NOT hardcode a universal threshold.
  - **Flags ABSTAIN, never corrects.** A high-entropy first token means "no confident answer here",
    not "the answer is X". Every detection-locus cell had ``modal_correct ~0`` for confab — the
    signal detects, it does not fix.
  - **First-token reaches white-box / weak models only.** On a strong CLOSED model (gpt-4o-mini) the
    FIRST-token signal FAILS — it confabulates downstream of the first token (B_contrast +0.22). For
    that regime use :func:`span_confab`, which aggregates across the answer span and recovered
    closed-model confab detection to EXACT N=10-resampling parity (AUC 0.991, B_contrast 0.000) on
    multi-token answers. Confident hallucination of SINGLE-token answers remains the open frontier.

Two detector entry points: :func:`single_pass_confab` (first answer token — white-box / weak-model)
and :func:`span_confab` (aggregate across a multi-token answer — the closed-model gate). Plus the
closed-loop action :func:`abstain_on_confab` — gate a candidate answer through a CALIBRATED detector
and return an honest abstention when it fires (the deployable "detect-and-abstain" primitive;
``FINDING_honesty_knob_2026_05_30.md`` showed the detector is load-bearing, so it refuses to act on
an uncalibrated score).

    and ``min_margin`` / ``mean_margin`` across the span. Still ONE forward pass, NO resampling.

    The first-token signal (:func:`single_pass_confab`) FAILS on strong closed models because they
    confabulate downstream of the first token (e.g. correct leading digits, wrong trailing). The span
    aggregate recovers it, validated on TWO gpt-4o-mini domains: multiplication (least-confident token
    ``min_margin`` AUC 0.991) and string reversal (most-uncertain token ``max_entropy`` AUC 0.993) —
    both matching N=10 resampling (0.991 / 0.997, B_contrast ~0.00) where the first-token gate managed
    only 0.76 / 0.57. The recovery is about confabulation LOCALIZATION (the model is uncertain exactly
    where it confabulates), not digit tokenization. The winning aggregate is domain-dependent
    (min-margin on numbers, max-entropy on character strings), so this returns BOTH — calibrate per
    model/domain. It is model-strength-invariant: span ties resampling on gpt-3.5-turbo (1.000),
    gpt-4o-mini (0.991), and frontier gpt-4o (1.000). Prefer it over the cheaper first-token
    :func:`single_pass_confab`, whose closed-model reliability is model-specific. A cheap (one forward
    pass vs ten) closed-model confab gate for structured answers. See
    ``FINDING_detection_locus_gpt_span_``, ``_gpt_reverse_``, and ``_gpt_xmodel_2026_05_30.md``.

    SCOPE: requires a MULTI-TOKEN answer with the error LOCALIZED to some token(s) — a single-token
    answer has no span (falls back to the first-token regime), and an error smeared evenly across all
    tokens would not localize. From the OpenAI API, build ``token_logits`` from each answer token's
    ``top_logprobs`` (the top-k logprobs serve as the per-token distribution).

    Parameters
    ----------
    token_logits : sequence of (sequence of float)
        One next-token logit vector per answer token. Empty span → degenerate all-zero score.

    margin_threshold : float, optional
        Abstain if ``min_margin <= margin_threshold`` (the validated primary closed-model gate).
