styxx.adapters.autogen — hook into microsoft autogen's multi-agent loop.

autogen agents communicate through a register_reply / generate_reply
protocol. this adapter hooks into that protocol so that every agent
reply passes through styxx.observe() on its way out. the agent's
behavior is never modified — styxx is a passive observer that attaches
vitals and fires any registered gate callbacks.

usage:

    import autogen
    import styxx
    from styxx.adapters.autogen import styxx_agent

    assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent("assistant", llm_config={...})
    styxx_agent(assistant)   # one line — now observed

    # or use the hook class directly for more control:
    from styxx.adapters.autogen import StyxxAutoGenHook
    hook = StyxxAutoGenHook()
    hook.attach(assistant)

the hook intercepts generate_reply by registering a reply function
via autogen's register_reply mechanism. the reply function calls the
original generate_reply, runs styxx.observe() on the result, and
returns it unchanged. if styxx fails for any reason, the original
reply passes through untouched.

fail-open contract
------------------
this adapter never raises exceptions into autogen's agent loop.
every code path that touches styxx internals is wrapped in a
try/except that swallows errors and warns. if autogen is not
installed, styxx_agent() returns the agent unchanged with no
side effects.

limitations:
  - tier 0 vitals require logprobs in the response. most autogen
    configurations use openai under the hood, so vitals will be
    available if the llm_config includes logprobs=True and
    top_logprobs=5. without those, .vitals will be None.
  - streaming replies are not intercepted (autogen's streaming
    path bypasses register_reply in some configurations).
