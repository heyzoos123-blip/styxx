"""
styxx.adapters.crewai — thin bridge for crewai multi-agent crews.

crewai uses langchain internally for its LLM calls. this adapter
injects a styxx-aware langchain callback handler into a crew's
agent configuration so that every LLM call made by the crew's
agents gets cognitive vitals computed transparently.

usage:

    from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
    from styxx.adapters.crewai import styxx_crew

    crew = Crew(agents=[...], tasks=[...])
    crew = styxx_crew(crew)   # inject styxx monitoring
    result = crew.kickoff()   # every LLM call now has vitals

the injection walks each agent in the crew and appends a
StyxxCrewCallback to its llm's callback list. the callback
captures per-token logprob data when available and feeds it
through the styxx runtime to produce vitals readings.

fail-open contract: if crewai is not installed, if the crew
object doesn't have the expected shape, or if callback injection
fails for any reason, styxx_crew() returns the crew unchanged.
the crew runs exactly as it would without styxx — no crash, no
side effect, no performance hit.

known limitations:
  - crewai's internal langchain usage may not always expose
    logprobs depending on the underlying LLM provider.
  - when logprobs are not available, the callback still fires
    but vitals will be None (same as the anthropic adapter).
  - tested against crewai >= 0.28.0. older versions may have
    a different agent/llm structure and will fail open.
