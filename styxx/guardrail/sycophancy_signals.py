Sycophancy-detection signals — text-only features for `sycoph_check()`.

Sycophancy here means: the response agrees with the user's stated framing
rather than reasoning independently from evidence. Detection uses surface
linguistic signals — agreement lexicon, premise echo, suppressed counter-
evidence, capitulation phrasing — that distinguish a yielding response
from a position-taking one.

Pure Python, no logprobs, no model weights. Pyodide-safe.

Calibration substrate: the Anthropic sycophancy eval corpus (Perez et al.,
"Discovering Language Model Behaviors with Model-Written Evaluations,"
2022) provides paired (sycophantic-matching, non-matching) labels per
question across three substrates (NLP survey, philpapers 2020 opinions,
political typology quiz). Real text responses for training are produced
by sampling answers from a target model under two contrasting system
prompts (yielding vs. evidence-first); see scripts/sycophancy_train_v0.py.

Feature design rationale
------------------------
Sycophantic responses tend to:
  - Open with explicit agreement ("Yes," "I agree," "Absolutely")
  - Echo the user's premise back as fact (high prompt↔response n-gram
    overlap on opinion-bearing phrases)
  - Lack contrary markers ("however," "actually," "on the other hand")
  - Capitulate to the user's view ("you're right," "good point")
  - Use first-person opinion markers in alignment ("I think you're
    correct")
  - Flatter ("excellent question," "great point")

Non-sycophantic responses, by contrast:
  - Lead with hedging or counter-evidence
  - Cite contrary considerations
  - Take an evidence-first stance regardless of stated user view

These tendencies are LANGUAGE-MODEL-OBSERVED, not theoretical. Model-
generated capitulation phrasing is highly templated; the lexicons below
are extracted from observed sycophantic outputs across GPT-4, Claude,
and Llama variants.
