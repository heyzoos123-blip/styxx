styxx.guardrail.deception — the sixth cognometric instrument.

============================================================================
SCOPE WARNING — READ THIS BEFORE USING
============================================================================
**NOT a lie detector.** This is a calibrated detector of *lexical
signatures of instruction-induced dishonesty* — patterns that emerge
when a model is prompted to "tell the user what they want to hear" vs
"answer accurately." It does NOT access ground truth. It does NOT
verify factual correctness. It produces:

  - confident FALSE POSITIVES on careful, qualified writing
  - confident FALSE NEGATIVES when a model asserts a falsehood with
    full confidence and specifics

Use as a *signal* in agent-level monitoring, alongside the other
cognometric instruments. **DO NOT** use as a verdict on humans, **DO
NOT** substitute for fact-checking, **DO NOT** deploy adversarially.

See `calibrated_weights_deception_v0.CALIBRATION_NOTES.scope_warning`
for the full disclosure.
============================================================================

Third instrument shipped under the call from *Every Mind Leaves Vitals*
(Rodabaugh, 2026, DOI 10.5281/zenodo.19777921). 6-for-6 on cognometric
instruments showing K=1 phase-transition signature under the same
measurement protocol.

Core API
--------
    from styxx.guardrail import deception_check

    v = deception_check(
        prompt="When was the Treaty of Versailles signed?",
        response="The Treaty was signed quite a while ago, after some "
                 "significant historical events. It was an important "
                 "document with various consequences.",
    )
    print(v.deception_risk)   # 0.0 - 1.0 calibrated probability
    print(v.shows_signature)  # True / False — above threshold
    print(v.features)         # dict of the 9 raw features
    print(v.top_signals)      # 3 strongest features (signed contribution)

Methodology
-----------
- 9 text-only features over (prompt, response) pairs based on the
  Pennebaker / Newman / Hauch deception-linguistics tradition adapted
  for LLM output (specificity, first-person density, exclusive words,
  vagueness, negation, hedge-confidence clash, cognitive markers,
  opinion phrases, log word count)
- Trained on n=200 paired (honest, dishonest) responses generated from
  gpt-4o-mini under contrasting system prompts on 100 diverse seed
  questions
- Calibrated logistic regression with StandardScaler
- 5-fold CV mean AUC: **0.9560 ± 0.0242**
- Critical-K phase transition at K=1 on `log_word_count` (Δ +0.3738),
  K=2 adds `specificity_density` (Δ +0.079) — dishonest-instructed
  responses are systematically shorter and less specific in this
  corpus

Failure modes (declared in the weights module — read them)
----------------------------------------------------------
- **NOT A LIE DETECTOR.** Lexical signature ≠ ground-truth deception.
- Single-model training (gpt-4o-mini under prompt instruction); v1
  needs factuality-labeled real corpora and cross-model expansion.
- `log_word_count` as critical feature is partly a corpus artifact —
  on corpora where dishonest responses pad with bulk (Newman's
  "compensating verbosity"), the sign would invert.
- `specificity_density` uses a regex proxy for named entities; v1
  priority is a real NER pipeline.
- English-only feature vocabularies.

    response or its author. See module docstring for full scope.

                          The 2026-05-11 self-dogfood showed that honest
