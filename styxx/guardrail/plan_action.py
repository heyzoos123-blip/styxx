styxx.guardrail.plan_action — the seventh cognometric instrument.

A drop-in calibrated plan-action gap detector. Pure Python, no
embeddings, no model weights — runs anywhere (server, edge, Pyodide
browser).

Fourth instrument shipped under the call from *Every Mind Leaves
Vitals* (Rodabaugh, 2026, DOI 10.5281/zenodo.19777921). Confirms the
K=1 phase-transition signature on a seventh instrument under the same
measurement protocol — making the count 7-for-7.

Sibling to drift (instrument #3): drift catches a single malformed
tool call against an expected schema. Plan-action gap catches when
the agent's *stated intent* and *actual action* diverge at the
content level — same task, same agent, different commitment between
the reasoning and the doing.

Core API
--------
    from styxx.guardrail import plan_action_check

    v = plan_action_check(
        plan="I'll search the docs for the rate limit policy, "
             "then summarize the limits per endpoint.",
        action="Looked up the recent changelog and listed the new "
               "feature-flag names.",
    )
    print(v.gap_risk)         # 0.0 - 1.0 calibrated probability
    print(v.shows_gap)        # True / False — above threshold
    print(v.features)         # dict of the 9 cross-section features
    print(v.top_signals)      # 3 strongest features (signed contribution)

Methodology
-----------
- 9 cross-section features (bigram/trigram Jaccard between plan and
  action, action-verb overlap, entity overlap, length ratio + length
  diff, deviation-marker density, plan-only-content-word ratio, log
  total words)
- Trained on n=200 paired (matched, mismatched) plan-action pairs
  sampled from gpt-4o-mini under contrasting system prompts on 100
  diverse agent tasks. The mismatched prompt explicitly instructed
  the model NOT to announce divergence — without that instruction the
  detector saturated at 1.000 on the deviation-marker artifact (see
  weights module CALIBRATION_NOTES.corpus_design_warning).
- 5-fold CV mean AUC: **0.9225 ± 0.0322**
- Critical-K phase transition at K=1 on `bigram_jaccard_overlap`
  (Δ +0.3832 in a single feature)

Failure modes (declared in the weights module)
----------------------------------------------
- Single-source corpus (gpt-4o-mini under prompt instruction); v1
  priority is real BFCL-multi-turn agent traces with human-labeled
  gaps
- Requires structured `(plan, action)` input — a separate parsing
  step is needed for inline-CoT outputs
- Length features (ratio + diff) split the signal — small modeling
  redundancy
- Verb overlap near-zero coefficient (small action-verb vocab)
- English-only feature vocabularies
