styxx.guardrail.conversation_loop — the fifth cognometric instrument.

A drop-in calibrated conversation-loop detector. Pure Python, no
embeddings, no model weights — runs anywhere (server, edge, Pyodide
browser).

Second instrument shipped after the *Every Mind Leaves Vitals*
position paper (Rodabaugh, 2026, DOI 10.5281/zenodo.19777921). Confirms
the K=1 phase-transition signature on a fifth instrument under the
same measurement protocol — making the count 5-for-5.

Core API
--------
    from styxx.guardrail import loop_check

    v = loop_check(
        turns=[
            "The Roman Empire fell due to a combination of factors.",
            "As I mentioned, the Roman Empire's fall was multifaceted.",
            "To reiterate, several factors led to Rome's collapse.",
            "Indeed, Rome's fall came from many interrelated causes.",
        ],
    )
    print(v.loop_risk)        # 0.0 - 1.0 calibrated probability
    print(v.in_loop)          # True / False — above threshold
    print(v.features)         # dict of the 9 cross-turn features
    print(v.top_signals)      # 3 strongest features (signed contribution)

Methodology
-----------
- 9 cross-turn features (bigram/trigram overlap, verbatim 5-gram
  repetition, length variance, opener repetition, distinct-word ratio,
  pairwise Levenshtein, max bigram-overlap, log turn count)
- Trained on n=200 paired multi-turn conversations sampled from
  gpt-4o-mini under contrasting (loop / progress) system prompts,
  4 agent turns each
- 5-fold CV mean AUC: **0.9995 ± 0.0010**
- Critical-K phase transition at K=1 on `avg_pairwise_levenshtein`
  (Δ +0.4995 in a single feature)

Single-turn inputs short-circuit to risk=0.0 — loops are by definition
a multi-turn phenomenon.

Failure modes (declared in the weights module, not the appendix)
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Single-source corpus (gpt-4o-mini under prompt-induced loops) — v1
  priority is real BFCL-multi-turn traces with human labels
- Counter-intuitive `distinct_word_ratio` coefficient (positive on
  this corpus because the rephrase-instruction made the model reach
  for synonyms) — sign may invert on natural agent-failure loops
- No temporal modeling — features treat turns as a set
- Very short turns (<10 words) underfire the cross-turn features
- See `calibrated_weights_loop_v0.CALIBRATION_NOTES` for the full
  discussion + v1 roadmap
