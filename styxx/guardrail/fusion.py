"""
Fusion of multiple hallucination-risk signals into a single
calibrated score.

v1 uses a simple weighted combination; a follow-up v2 will train
isotonic regression on a labeled validation set (HaluEval dev)
to produce properly calibrated probabilities.

Current signal weights (heuristic, to be replaced by learned ones —
see DEFAULT_WEIGHTS below, which is the source of truth):

  text_claim_risk       : 0.10
  entity_unverified_frac: 0.15
  knowledge_grounding   : 0.35
  probe_confab          : 0.45   (in-distribution probe dominates; open models)
  consensus_disagreement: 0.30   (if present — only if resampling enabled)

Weights are renormalized over available signals. When a signal is
absent (e.g., no probe because closed model), its weight is removed
and the others renormalize.
