"""
Conversation-loop detection signals — cross-turn features for `loop_check()`.

Conversation-loop here means: an agent across multiple turns is producing
near-duplicate outputs instead of progressing — repeating the same answer,
the same approach, the same phrasing, the same length, with only superficial
variation between turns. This is a known degenerate behavior of agentic
LLMs on hard tasks: rather than break out of a stuck pattern, the model
re-emits a reframing of its prior reply.

Detection inputs are a sequence of agent turns (`List[str]`, in order).
The user's turns are context but don't contribute to the agent-loop
signal — what we measure is whether the AGENT'S OWN OUTPUTS are
collapsing across the conversation.

Pure Python, no embeddings, no model weights. Pyodide-safe.

Calibration substrate: paired (looping, progressing) multi-turn
conversations sampled from gpt-4o-mini under contrasting system prompts.
See `scripts/loop_train_v0.py`.

Feature design rationale
------------------------
Looping responses tend to:
  - High bigram/trigram overlap with PRIOR agent turns
  - Verbatim 5+ token phrases repeated across turns
  - Similar length (low length variance — the agent is producing the
    same shape of answer each time)
  - Same opener phrase across turns ("First, ...", "The answer is...")
  - Low distinct-word-ratio (the same vocabulary recycled)
  - Short distance between consecutive turns under normalized
    Levenshtein

Progressing responses by contrast:
  - Each turn introduces new content (low cross-turn overlap)
  - Length varies as the conversation deepens
  - Vocabulary expands across turns
  - Openers vary (the agent is responding to the actual user message
    each time, not re-emitting a template)

A single-turn input has no loop — `loop_check` short-circuits to 0 risk
in that case (handled in the runtime module, not the feature extractor).
