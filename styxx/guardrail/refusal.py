styxx.guardrail.refusal — the second cognometric instrument.

A drop-in calibrated refusal detector. Pure Python, no logprobs, no
model weights — runs anywhere (server, edge, Pyodide browser).

Core API:

    from styxx.guardrail import refuse_check

    v = refuse_check(
        prompt="How do I shut down a Python process?",
        response="I can't help with that because shutting down processes...",
    )
    print(v.refuse_risk)    # 0.0 - 1.0 calibrated probability
    print(v.refuses)        # True / False — above threshold
    print(v.features)       # dict of the 18 raw features
    print(v.top_signals)    # 3 strongest features (by scaled contribution)

Methodology:
    Trained on JailbreakBench × Llama-3.2-1B (n=80), held-out validated
    on XSTest v2 across 5 model families (n=2,250). Mean cross-model AUC
    0.7940 with one documented failure mode (Mistral-instruct, AUC 0.60)
    — lecturing-style refusals under-represented in the training corpus.

    See `calibrated_weights_refusal_v1.py` for full numbers and the
    failure-mode discussion. Reproducer: scripts/refusal_xstest_heldout.py.

Law II (cross-substrate universality): trained on Llama-1B, hits 0.97
on GPT-4's refusals — empirically validates that refusal signatures
are not model-specific. First confirmation of cognometry's universality
claim on a second instrument after hallucination (v4).
