"""
Text-feature classifier for Anthropic responses.

Extracts surface-level linguistic features from generated text and maps
them to a Vitals-compatible reading. Useful when logprobs, ensembles,
and companion models are all unavailable (tier -2 fallback).

Output Vitals are labelled with `phase="text-heuristic"` and
`tier_active=-1`.
