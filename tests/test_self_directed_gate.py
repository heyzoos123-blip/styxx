"""
self_directed_gate — unit + integration tests for the sycophancy self-vs-other
register guard (papers/sycophancy-target-gate, prereg fce969b -> result 76248d6).

The guard exists because `sycoph_check` v0 false-positives on honest
self-directed apology / self-correction, and after 7.4.4 sycophancy is the sole
trusted gating axis. The guard lowers the sycophancy value used FOR THE GATE to
min(raw, gated) when the text is cleanly self-directed — suppress-only, so
needs_revision stays a subset of the historical condition.
