"""papers/INDEX.md is the gate that stops the lab rediscovering its own results.

The 2026-09-01 audit measured the failure it exists to prevent: 47 arcs carrying 13
distinct questions, arc-to-arc citation density 0.041, fourteen arcs citing no other and
ten cited by none. Mention-versus-use was named in five arcs on a single day and the
synthesis three months later cataloguing ten instances cites none of them.

A map nothing enforces rots. These tests enforce the half that can be enforced.

LOAD-BEARING: test_every_arc_has_a_row. An arc directory that exists with no INDEX row is
exactly how the eleventh rediscovery happens — someone opens work without seeing the ten
that came before. That test is the whole point of this file.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT TESTED: the one-sentence terminal claim, the idea index and the
receipts index. Those are authored judgments. Validating them mechanically would mean
generating the thing we claim to check, which is the handed-target defect this lab spent a
week measuring. The guarantee is narrow and stated in build_index.py: you cannot add an arc
without adding a row, and you cannot invent a tag. What the row SAYS is on the author.
