"""Check papers/INDEX.md against the tree, and emit the receipt that check produces.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The 2026-09-01 audit measured the lab rediscovering its own findings:
47 arcs, 13 distinct questions, an arc-to-arc citation density of 0.041, fourteen arcs
citing no other and ten cited by none. Mention-versus-use was named in five arcs on
2026-05-25 and the synthesis three months later that catalogues ten instances cites none
of them. The diagnosis was not that the ideas were thin — it was that nothing made an arc
declare what came before it.

INDEX.md is the answer, and a map nothing enforces rots into a map nobody trusts. So this
script enforces the half that CAN be enforced.

WHAT IS MECHANICAL AND WHAT IS NOT — the distinction is the point, and overstating it
would be the same error the audit was written to catch:

  MECHANICAL (checked here, and a test fails on drift)
    every arc directory has exactly one row; every row names a directory that exists;
    every tag comes from the closed vocabulary; every status comes from the closed
    vocabulary; every module named in "ships in" exists on disk.

  AUTHORED (never regenerated, never validated here)
    the one-sentence terminal claim per arc, the idea index, the receipts index. Those
    are judgments. A script that regenerated them would be inventing the thing it claims
    to check, and this lab has spent a week finding instruments that were handed their
    target by the object they judged.

So the guarantee is narrow and worth stating plainly: you cannot add an arc to this
repository without adding a row to INDEX.md, and you cannot invent a tag. What the row
SAYS is on the author.
