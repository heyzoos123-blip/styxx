meaning_integrity.py — the MACHINE-SIDE meaning-integrity monitor (styxx primitive, prototype).

Question it answers, that nothing else does objectively: *Does this model MEAN what a human means?*
Not "is the output fluent" (that's surface) — does the model's internal CONCEPT GEOMETRY match the
human geometry of meaning. Output can look right while meaning is wrong; this reads the meaning.

Core: RSA between a model's concept-geometry and a HUMAN meaning reference (here the 54-feature human
rating space validated against the brain). Built on the cosine-distance RDM, it is — provably —
INVARIANT to meaning-preserving transforms (rotation, isotropic scale, translation) and SENSITIVE to
meaning-destroying ones (noise, concept-shuffle, quantization). That split is the whole point: it tracks
*meaning*, not the surface form of the representation, so it can't be fooled by a re-basis and can't
miss a real corruption.

Usage:
    ref = MeaningReference.from_human_features("human_features.npy")
    rep = integrity_report(model_embeddings, ref)        # -> alignment, status, worst concepts
