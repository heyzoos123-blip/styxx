## Abstract

A recurring intuition holds that mind runs on frequency, and that *higher* frequency means a higher
state. Put inside a computational mind, this becomes a family of sharp, falsifiable predictions about
oscillation and memory. We test them in a complex-diagonal linear recurrent unit (LRU) trained on an
ordered-copy task, with every prediction frozen before data, and we report the negatives as carefully
as the positives. Six results draw a demarcation. **(1)** Oscillation is a capacity-extending mechanism:
a phase-clamp ablation roughly *doubles* ordered-memory capacity (kcap 6.0 vs 2.67). **(2)** Capacity is
**resonant** in frequency, not monotonic — it peaks in an interior band (~0.06–0.5π rad/step) and
*collapses* at the Nyquist limit to at-or-below the no-rhythm baseline; the folk "higher is better" is
falsified (Spearman 0.16). **(3)** The optimum is set by *how many* items are held, not *how long*
(θ\*·W scaling NULL). **(4)** Oscillation is **not special**: at matched parameters a rhythm-free
transformer more than doubles the oscillatory LRU's capacity (15.3 vs 6.0) — attention does ordered
memory better, with no rhythm at all. **(5)** Oscillation does **not generalize**: trained on short
sequences and tested longer, the oscillatory net is *worst*, at chance — it is a length-specialization,
not a length-invariant principle. **(6)** Oscillation multiplexes at a **constant** factor (~1.8×) across
a 16× range of state sizes, *not* preferentially under scarcity — the "rhythm matters more when neurons
are scarce" reconciliation is not supported. The honest landing: frequency is fundamental to memory as a
*band to tune, not a ladder to climb* — and even tuned, it is a real but dominated, non-generalizing,
constant-factor recurrent mechanism, not the secret of mind. Past the optimum, higher frequency is the
computational analogue of a seizure, not enlightenment. **(7)** But on a different axis — **noise
robustness** — the phase code wins: it loses less capacity under state noise than the decay code (−33% vs
−50%) and survives a scale-fairness control in the strong direction (more robust *despite* a smaller
state). This is the first regime where oscillation is not dominated, and it matches what neuroscience says
rhythms are *for* — robust coding, not raw storage. **(8)** And on *timing* — periodic prediction,
oscillation's native task — it is the native mechanism: perfect at every period while the decay net
collapses (its edge grows with period), and *undominated* by attention (both saturate) — though co-equal,
not supreme, and not via simple resonance (a phase-probe shows a distributed multi-frequency basis, not
θ≈2π/P tuning). **(9)** And when we break that ceiling — periodic prediction under input corruption —
rhythm still only *ties* attention (identical degradation to three decimals), never beating it. The map
closes in its tightened form: **across every fair comparison with attention — capacity, clean timing,
noisy timing — rhythm never strictly wins; it loses or ties, and its only clean victories are over its own
decay baseline.** Oscillation is one efficient way a recurrent system encodes time and resists noise, not a
privileged or superior substrate for cognition — the demarcated, true (and smallest) shape of "frequency
is fundamental to mind."

## 1. Introduction

That rhythm matters to cognition is old and well-supported: theta–gamma coupling is credited with
holding ordered items in working memory (Lisman & Jensen 2013), and the "magic number" capacity of
working memory (Miller 1956) has long been linked to nested oscillations. A stronger, folk version of
the idea — *raise your frequency, raise your mind* — makes predictions the careful literature does not.
Readable in-silico models let us test the strong version directly, with predictions registered in
advance. We do so in an LRU (Orvieto et al. 2023), the minimal recurrent substrate whose eigenvalues
expose oscillation as a single knob: the phase θ of a complex eigenvalue λ = r·e^{iθ}. Crucially, we
also include a rhythm-free control — a transformer — so "does rhythm help a recurrent net?" is never
confused with "is rhythm the best way?"

## 2. Theory: a phase code over the retention window

A single complex mode is a *clock with a fade*: an item written at time τ contributes
r^{t−τ}·e^{iθ(t−τ)} at readout t — a decaying magnitude (a recency gradient) and a phase that tags
*when* it was written. Ordered recall needs the phase channel: K items written one step apart carry
phases spaced by θ. Two failure modes bound the useful range — at θ→0 the items share phase ~0 (no
order code), and at θ→π (Nyquist) the mode flips sign every step so adjacent items are maximally
confusable. Between them lies an optimum where the held items tile the phase circle ~once. **The
resonance is therefore the generic signature of a phase code** (full derivation:
`THEORY_phase_coding_2026_06_04.md`). The same model shows the optimum is set by one of two competing
budgets — the *number* of items (write-span; θ\*~c/K) or the *duration* of the hold (window; θ\*~c/W) —
which experiment 3 adjudicates.

**Scope of the theory (an explicit negative).** This phase-coding account is *qualitative*. We tried to
make it quantitative — a linear code-geometry model predicting the optimum in closed form — and it
**fails to reproduce the resonance** (`NEGATIVE_analytic_shortcut_2026_06_04.md`): the decay-magnitude
structure dominates the linear spectrum, and the phase-separability benefit materializes only through
the *trained nonlinear readout*. The mechanism explains the shape; it does not yet predict the optimum
from first principles, and the empirical sweeps remain the arbiter.

## 3. Experiment 1 — oscillation doubles ordered-memory capacity (phase-clamp ablation)

Two LRUs, identical in every weight init except the eigenvalue phase: FREE (θ learnable → can
rotate/oscillate) vs CLAMPED (θ≡0 → real eigenvalues, pure decay). Matched state, parameters, and RNG
draws; only rotation differs. Ordered copy, 3 seeds.

| K | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| FREE acc | 1.00 | 0.99 | 0.99 | 0.97 | 0.90 | 0.73 | 0.64 |
| CLAMPED acc | 1.00 | 0.96 | 0.82 | 0.72 | 0.59 | 0.46 | 0.39 |

Capacity (kcap, acc≥0.80): **FREE 6.0 vs CLAMPED 2.67** — oscillation ≈ doubles ordered-memory
capacity; the gap widens with load; the free net keeps its rotation (osc_use 0.62). Oscillation is a
real, capacity-extending recurrent mechanism — used when available, only partially substitutable (by
multi-timescale decay) when not.

## 4. Experiment 2 — capacity is resonant in frequency, not monotonic

Freezing θ at fixed values swept 0→Nyquist (one network per frequency), 3 seeds:

| θ/π | 0.0 | 0.0625 | 0.125 | 0.1875 | 0.25 | **0.375** | 0.5 | 0.6875 | 0.875 | 0.97 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| kcap | 2.67 | 4.00 | 3.67 | 3.67 | 4.00 | **5.33** | 4.00 | 4.00 | 4.00 | **2.00** |

Interior peak at θ\*≈0.375π; collapse to 2.00 at Nyquist — below the no-rhythm baseline at the
registered 0.80 threshold. Monotonic "higher is better" is falsified (Spearman 0.16; the highest
frequency is the global *minimum*). **Robustness:** RESONANT verdict and falsification hold across
thresholds 0.70–0.90 and all 3 seeds. Two sub-claims bounded: the optimum is a *band* (~0.06–0.5π), not
a point; "below baseline" is threshold-specific ("at-or-below, never above").

## 5. Experiment 3 — the optimum is item-count-bound, not window-bound (scaling NULL)

Pre-registered (`PREREG_scaling_law_2026_06_04.md`): insert a delay of D pad tokens between write and
recall, locate θ\*(D), test θ\*·W ≈ const. NULL ⇒ item-count-bound; SCALING ⇒ window-bound. **Result:
NULL.** Across delays D ∈ {0,6,12,24}, θ\* held at ≈0.03–0.0625π — it did **not** move with the window.
A de-saturated re-run with a continuous capacity measure (area under acc-vs-K) **confirmed the NULL**.
The optimum is set by *how many* items are held, not *how long* — consistent with the relative-phase-
preservation arm of the theory. The pre-registered SCALING bet was wrong; the theory's self-correction
(lean NULL) was right — recorded as such.

## 6. Experiment 4 — oscillation is not special: attention wins rhythm-free (necessity)

The decisive control. A matched-parameter (~168k) showdown on the same task, 3 seeds: LRU-CLAMPED
(decay) vs LRU-FREE (oscillatory) vs TRANSFORMER (attention, no rhythm).

| arm | LRU-clamped | LRU-free | **Transformer** |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| kcap | 2.67 | 6.0 | **15.3** |

Oscillation helps a *recurrent* net (free 6.0 vs clamped 2.67, replicating experiment 1) — **but a
rhythm-free transformer more than doubles the oscillatory LRU at equal parameters.** Attention does
ordered memory better than rhythm. This is the controlled, quantitative refutation of "rhythm underlies
(ordered) cognition": oscillation is *one efficient recurrent mechanism*, not necessary and not optimal.
The honest demarcation is earned here, by experiment, not asserted.

## 7. Experiment 5 — oscillation does not generalize: it is a length-specialization (extrapolation)

Train on K≤8, test on K up to 20 (sinusoidal positions for the transformer, for a fair length test).
3 seeds.

| arm | in-distribution (K≤8) | extrapolation (K>8) |
|---|---:|---:|
| LRU-free | 0.978 | **0.088 (chance = 1/12)** |
| LRU-clamped | — | 0.175 |
| Transformer | — | 0.165 |

The oscillatory net, best in-distribution, is **worst out-of-distribution — dead at chance** — and the
decay net slightly *beats* it. Oscillation over-fits the trained item-counts (coherent with the
scaling-NULL: θ\* tracks item-count), so it transfers nothing to new lengths. Rhythm here is a
length-*specialization*, not a length-invariant principle.

## 8. Experiment 6 — oscillation multiplexes at a constant factor, not under scarcity (multiplexing)

The deepest pro-oscillation framing — the actual theta–gamma *capacity-per-resource* claim: does
oscillation's advantage *grow* when the state dimension D is starved? Sweep D ∈ {16…256}, free vs
clamped, 3 seeds.

| D | 16 | 24 | 32 | 48 | 64 | 128 | 256 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ratio free/clamped | 2.33 | 1.75 | 1.50 | 1.83 | 1.78 | 1.64 | 2.25 |

**Half-true.** *Refuted:* the ratio is flat (Spearman(D, ratio) = −0.07; 2.33 at D=16 ≈ 2.25 at D=256) —
oscillation's advantage does **not** grow under scarcity, so "rhythm matters more when neurons are
scarce → why biology uses it" is not supported in silico. *Confirmed:* the ratio is a robust **constant
~1.8×** at every D — genuine phase-multiplexing (~2 items per mode), but resource-*independent*. The
mechanism is real; its resource-dependence is not.

## 9. Experiment 7 — the phase code is more noise-robust than the decay code (oscillation's first sovereign regime)

Pre-registered (`PREREG_noise_2026_06_04.md`). The most-cited reason biology phase-codes: a phase (2-D
angle) is said to survive corruption a 1-D magnitude/decay code cannot. Gaussian noise into the recurrent
state at every timestep (train + eval), sweep σ, D=256, free vs clamped, 3 seeds.

| σ | 0.0 | 0.05 | 0.10 | 0.20 | 0.40 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| free kcap | 6.00 | 6.00 | 6.00 | 4.00 | 4.00 |
| clamped kcap | 2.67 | 2.67 | 2.00 | 2.00 | 1.33 |

**The decay net loses half its capacity (−50%); the oscillatory net a third (−33%), and is
noise-insensitive up to σ=0.1.** The phase code degrades more gracefully. **Fairness control**
(`run_noise_control.py`, the load-bearing check): absolute noise is fair only if state magnitudes match —
measured RMS **free 1.33 vs clamped 1.72**, so the oscillatory net is more robust *despite a worse
noise-to-signal ratio*; the result is not a scale artifact and is if anything understated (the reverse of
the pre-flagged confound). Bounded: the σ-by-σ *ratio* is jagged on tiny integer kcaps (the claim rests
on the fractional-loss gap + the control, not the ratio trend); and this is oscillation-vs-decay, **not**
oscillation-vs-attention (state-noise has no fair transformer analogue — untested there). Still, the first
regime in the arc where rhythm is not dominated by its baseline.

## 10. Experiment 8 — timing is oscillation's native domain (the steelman)

Pre-registered (`PREREG_timing_2026_06_04.md`). Experiments 1–6 used ordered *copy* — a pure *memory*
task. Oscillation's native function is *timing*: a phase is a clock. We test periodic next-symbol
prediction (infer the period, phase-track the next element — what an oscillator does and a leaky-decay
state structurally cannot), three matched-param arms, P swept 2→12, 3 seeds.

| P | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| free | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| clamped | 0.97 | 0.85 | 0.71 | 0.65 | 0.54 | 0.43 |
| transformer | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.99 | 0.99 |

**Three honest parts.** *(P1, decisive)* Oscillation is the native mechanism: perfect at every period
while the decay net collapses (0.97 → 0.43) — its edge over decay *grows* with period (Spearman 1.00,
+0.57 at P=12). On its own task, rhythm crushes the decay baseline it merely doubled on capacity. *(P2,
ceiling tie — correcting the gate's "sovereign")* free and transformer both **saturate** (1.00 vs 0.99);
rhythm is *undominated* by attention here — a real change from capacity, where attention won 15.3 vs 6.0 —
but it does not *beat* attention; both max out and only decay fails. The honest word is co-equal, and a
harder (jittered/noisy) timing task is needed to resolve them. *(Mechanism — resonance refuted)* a
phase-spectrum probe shows the free net does **not** learn θ≈2π/P: enrichment near each target is ~1.0×
(chance), and it solves short periods whose 2π/P lies outside its phase range entirely. It wins via a
broad, diverse bank of phases — a distributed Fourier-like temporal basis — not single-tone resonance.
The reframe holds: rhythm is dominated for capacity, native and undominated for timing — pending the
ceiling-breaker (exp 9).

## 11. Experiment 9 — the ceiling-breaker: rhythm ties attention under corruption (it never strictly beats it)

Pre-registered (`PREREG_noisy_timing_2026_06_05.md`). Exp 8 was a *ceiling* tie, leaving open whether
rhythm beats attention on a *harder* temporal task. We break the ceiling with input corruption (replace
each input symbol with a random one w.p. ρ — fair to all arms, unlike exp-7 state noise; predict the clean
periodic continuation), ρ swept, averaged over P∈{4,6,8}, 3 seeds.

| ρ | 0.0 | 0.1 | 0.2 | 0.3 | 0.4 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| free | 0.995 | 0.958 | 0.902 | 0.825 | 0.725 |
| transformer | 1.000 | 0.970 | 0.915 | 0.829 | 0.717 |
| clamped | 0.632 | 0.530 | 0.453 | 0.387 | 0.330 |

**P1 refuted.** free − transformer = **+0.002** at high corruption; the curves are within ±0.013 at every
ρ and cross at ρ=0.4 — statistically indistinguishable, identical graceful degradation, while decay sits at
the floor. Rhythm's distributed phase code denoises periodic structure *exactly as well as* attention's
lookup, not better. So **across every fair comparison with attention — capacity, clean timing, noisy timing
— rhythm never strictly wins; it loses or ties.** The interesting residue is the *null itself*: two
architectures with nothing in common produce the same robustness curve to three decimals — architectural
convergence on one solution, not a rhythm advantage.

## 12. Discussion

Frequency is fundamental to ordered memory, but as a **resonance, not a ladder** — and a *dominated*
one. The mechanism is phase-coding over the retention window: too slow and items do not separate; too
fast and the phase wraps, aliasing the stored items. The collapse at maximum frequency is the
computational signature of the principle by which hypersynchrony in tissue is pathology: a seizure, not
insight. The phase-clamp result (exp 1) gives controlled support to the theta–gamma account; the
attention control (exp 4), the extrapolation failure (exp 5), and the resource-flat multiplexing (exp 6)
locate rhythm precisely — a real, resonant, length-specific, constant-factor recurrent *efficiency*
mechanism that a rhythm-free architecture dominates on raw capacity. The folk claim "higher frequency =
higher mind" is, for ordered memory, false in every component we could test. But capacity is not the only
axis, and it is the one rhythm is *worst* on. On **robustness** (exp 7) the phase code loses less capacity
under state noise than the decay code, control-cleared in the strong direction; on **timing** (exp 8),
oscillation's native task, it is the native mechanism — perfect across periods where the decay code
collapses, and undominated (co-equal) with attention. Neither positive is "rhythm beats everything":
robustness is measured against decay, not attention; timing is a ceiling tie with attention, not a win;
and the timing mechanism is a distributed phase basis, not the single-tone resonance the folk picture
imagines. The honest two-axis map: **rhythm is dominated for memory capacity, native and undominated for
robust, temporal coding** — which is the direction modern neuroscience has moved on what brain rhythms are
*for* (coordination, robustness, timing), and the demarcated, true shape of the intuition we set out to
test. We then tried to break that ceiling (exp 9): periodic prediction under input corruption, the
hardness axis tied most directly to oscillation's claimed noise-robustness. Rhythm still only *ties*
attention — identical degradation to three decimals — so the honest map sharpens once more: **across every
fair comparison with attention, rhythm never strictly wins; it loses (capacity) or ties (clean and noisy
timing). Its only clean victories are over its own decay baseline.** Oscillation is one efficient way a
recurrent system encodes time and resists noise — not a privileged or superior substrate for cognition.
The genuinely open doors are other hardness axes (jittered/drifting periods, long horizons, compositional
or continuous-time structure) where the two architectures might yet diverge.

## 13. Limitations

In-silico; one task family (ordered copy; periodic prediction in exp 8), recurrent and attention
architectures, 3 seeds, capacity at a 0.80 threshold. The theory is an order-of-magnitude phase-coding
argument, not an exact capacity theorem. We make no claim about human consciousness — the
"frequency/consciousness" framing is the *intuition tested*, and the data refine it into statements
about computational memory. Every claim was registered before its data; sub-claims that did not survive
re-derivation are bounded in text, not removed.

## 14. Methods

Complex-diagonal LRU (256 modes unless swept), |λ|∈[0.9,0.999], complex input projection (matched 2-D
real state across arms), 2-layer GELU readout. Transformer control: matched ~168k params, learned or
sinusoidal positions as noted, causal mask. Ordered-copy: K symbols (vocab 12) then K GO tokens, recall
in order. Adam, lr 2e-3, 4000 steps, batch 64, grad-clip 1.0. Each result is the mean over 3 seeds;
capacity = largest K with mean acc ≥ 0.80. Pre-registrations, runners, results, and figures committed
