# RESULT — permuted-MNIST oscillation ablation: the gap WIDENS 7.6× — 2026-07-23

> **Forward-pointer, added 2026-09-02.** The confound in this knob was tested here: a rotation-free bank with doubled timescales recovers 0.034 of the 0.317 gap, `PARTIAL__diversity_recovers_some` — see `RESULT_pmnist_untied_2026_09_02.md`.

> **Forward-pointer, added 2026-09-02.** The phase clamp used here also ties each mode's real channels to one magnitude; on the ordered-copy task a preregistered untied control recovered none of the gap (rotation load-bearing beyond diversity), and the same control on this benchmark is the owed next preregistration — see `papers/rhythm-rescue/RESULT_untied_magnitudes_2026_09_02.md`. The text below is unchanged.

Frozen by `PREREG_pmnist_ablation_2026_07_23.md`. Receipt: `pmnist_ablation_result.json`. Runner:
`run_pmnist_ablation.py` (deep S5/LinOSS-class classifier + fixed permutation, parallel scan
red-team-verified). 2 seeds, 4000 steps, RTX 4070. **Verdict: OSCILLATION LOAD-BEARING; WIDENS vs
sMNIST** — the sharpened flagship.

## One line

On **permuted MNIST** (a fixed pixel shuffle destroys locality → genuinely long-range), the oscillatory
model reaches **92.0%** while a bit-for-bit-identical decay model is stuck at **60.7%** — a **+31.2-point**
gap, **7.6× the +4.1 points** measured on sequential MNIST. When locality can no longer substitute for
oscillation, the oscillation's causal role *explodes*. This is the sharpest confirmation that oscillation
is what makes an SSM a long-range model.

## Results (test accuracy on 10k held-out, permuted)

| arm | seed 0 | seed 1 | mean |
|---|---|---|---|
| **FREE** (θ learnable, oscillatory) | 0.9240 | 0.9150 | **0.9195** |
| **CLAMPED** (θ≡0, pure decay) | 0.5529 | 0.6617 | **0.6073** |

`FREE − CLAMPED = +0.3122`. Matched-param (101,002 vs 100,810) and RNG-matched; the single knob is θ.
Within-model reliance: clamping the trained FREE model's θ→0 in place drops it to **0.1027** (chance),
a reliance of **+0.8168**.

## The sharpening (the headline)

| task | oscillation gap (FREE − CLAMPED) | decay model can do it? |
|---|---|---|
| sequential MNIST (has locality) | +0.0408 | yes-ish (94.3%) |
| **permuted MNIST (no locality)** | **+0.3122** | **no (60.7%)** |

The gap **widens 7.6×**. Two causal facts make this decisive and *not* a smoke artifact: (i) on
sequential MNIST a decay model reaches 94% by exploiting adjacent-pixel structure, so the oscillation
gap is small; (ii) remove that crutch (permute) and the decay model collapses to 61% while the
oscillatory model still reaches 92% — the oscillation *is* the long-range mechanism. Unlike the
adaptive-frequency swings (where 1-seed smokes over-predicted the full run), here the gap **grew** from
smoke (+0.131) to full training (+0.312), because the decay model plateaus while the oscillatory one
keeps improving.

## Reading

This is the strongest form of the flagship: the controlled single-knob oscillation-vs-decay ablation,
on a genuinely long-range benchmark, shows oscillation is not merely helpful but *load-bearing for
long-range modeling itself* — a decay SSM of equal budget simply cannot solve permuted MNIST, and an
otherwise-identical oscillatory one can. Combined with Appendix A of the paper (the phase-clamp is
LinOSS's oscillation ablation by the math), this is a causal statement about the LinOSS/S5 class on real
long-range data that the whole-architecture benchmarks cannot make.

Scope: `H=64`, three blocks, 4000 steps, two seeds, one permutation (`perm_seed` 1234). A permutation-averaged
version and Long Range Arena would extend it; the effect is already large and seed-stable. OATH-certified.
