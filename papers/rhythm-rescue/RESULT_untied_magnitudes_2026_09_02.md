## The confound, and the arm

The phase clamp does two things at once: it removes rotation, and it ties each complex mode's two
real channels to one magnitude. REAL2 — a real-eigenvalue bank with 2D modes and 2D independent
magnitudes, no rotation — has exactly FREE's state size and parameter count
(<sworn r="path:papers/rhythm-rescue/untied_control_result.json#/arms/real2/params" k="numeric">168524 parameters</sworn> against
<sworn r="path:papers/rhythm-rescue/untied_control_result.json#/arms/free/params" k="numeric">FREE's 168524</sworn>), and strictly more timescale diversity than either
existing arm. If the clamp's loss had been diversity, REAL2 would recover it.

## The finding

Untying the magnitudes recovers nothing. A real bank with twice FREE's independent timescales
holds ordered items exactly as poorly as the tied bank, at every K: the two curves lie on each
other. Whatever the rotation buys, it is not a richer spread of decay rates — it is the rotation.
The arc's headline, that oscillation is causally load-bearing in state-space models, survives
the sharpest control its own knob admits, and the theta-gamma reading — phase as the code for
order — is strengthened rather than scoped.

## What this does not say

One task family (ordered copy), one width, three seeds, no interval, toy scale. The flagship
permuted-MNIST number (+0.312) was measured with the same knob and carries the same confound; this
result makes the diversity reading unlikely there but does not test it, and the permuted-MNIST
re-run with a REAL2 arm is the next preregistration. Nothing here is about real LinOSS or Mamba
checkpoints. The disclosed prior was uncertain and the bet was real; it came out on the side of
rotation, and the numbers say so at the resolution of a capacity grid.

> **Forward-pointer, added 2026-09-02.** The same contrast on permuted MNIST scored `PARTIAL__diversity_recovers_some`: rotation carries about nine tenths of the gap, diversity at most a tenth, inside two-seed noise — see `../frequency-resonance/RESULT_pmnist_untied_2026_09_02.md`.

*The knob turned two things; the second turned out to be nothing. The rhythm was the rhythm.*
